If you're planning to compile the source code to create your own executable, please note that a DevExpress License is required. Additionally, make sure to copy the "Screenshots", "INIs", and "Images" folders from the DMONET folder in the downloaded .rar/.zip file to the following directory:

DMONET3\TestUI\bin\Debug

These folders are essential for proper functionality if you plan on compiling your own executable.

For those not compiling the source code, the downloaded .rar/.zip file is already fully set up and ready to use. Simply extract and run!
